## C\# Custom Course: 3-Week Program

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of C\# programming, from foundational syntax to advanced architectural patterns and concurrent programming. Each week builds upon the previous, ensuring a solid learning progression.

-----

### Week 1: C\# Fundamentals

This week lays the groundwork for C\# programming. You'll learn the basic building blocks of the language, how to write simple programs, handle user input, control program flow, and manage data using fundamental data structures.

#### **Learning Objectives:**

  * Understand basic C\# syntax and program structure.
  * Work with different data types and variables.
  * Implement decision-making and looping constructs.
  * Create and use methods for code organization.
  * Store and manipulate collections of data using arrays.

#### **Concepts Explained:**

  * **C\# Structures:**

      * **Definition:** Value types that typically encapsulate small groups of related variables. They are similar to classes but are stored on the stack and passed by value.
      * **Use Case:** Ideal for representing lightweight objects like points, colors, or coordinates where behavior is minimal.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public struct Point
    {
        public int X;
        public int Y;

        public Point(int x, int y)
        {
            X = x;
            Y = y;
        }
    }
    ```

  * **Types:**

      * **Definition:** C\# is a strongly-typed language, meaning every variable has a type that determines what kind of values it can hold (e.g., numbers, text, true/false).
      * **Categories:**
          * **Value Types:** Store their data directly (e.g., `int`, `double`, `bool`, `char`, `struct`).
          * **Reference Types:** Store a reference to the data, which is stored elsewhere in memory (e.g., `string`, `class`, `object`).

  * **Variables:**

      * **Definition:** Named storage locations that hold data of a specific type.
      * **Declaration:** `DataType variableName = initialValue;`

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    int age = 30;
    string name = "Alice";
    bool isActive = true;
    ```

  * **Collecting User Input:**

      * **Method:** Using `Console.ReadLine()` to read a line of text from the console. This input is always a `string` and needs to be converted if a different type is required (e.g., `int.Parse()`, `Convert.ToInt32()`).

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    Console.Write("Enter your name: ");
    string userName = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {userName}!");
    ```

  * **Flow of Control:**

      * **Conditional Statements:**
          * **`if`, `else if`, `else`**: Execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
          * **`switch`**: A multi-way branch statement that provides an alternative to a long `if-else if` chain for multiple conditions based on a single variable's value.
      * **Looping Constructs:**
          * **`for` loop**: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
          * **`while` loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
          * **`do-while` loop**: Similar to `while`, but guarantees the code block executes at least once.
          * **`foreach` loop**: Iterates over elements in a collection.

  * **Random:**

      * **Class:** The `Random` class generates pseudo-random numbers.
      * **Usage:** Create an instance of `Random` and use its `Next()` methods to get random integers within a range.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    Random rand = new Random();
    int randomNumber = rand.Next(1, 101); // Generates a number between 1 and 100
    ```

  * **Methods:**

      * **Definition:** Blocks of code that perform a specific task. They promote code reusability and organization.
      * **Syntax:** `[access_modifier] [return_type] MethodName([parameters]) { ... }`

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public void GreetUser(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Greetings, {name}!");
    }

    public int Add(int num1, int num2)
    {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
    ```

  * **Arrays:**

      * **Definition:** Fixed-size collections of elements of the same data type. Elements are accessed by an index (starting from 0).
      * **Declaration:** `DataType[] arrayName = new DataType[size];` or `DataType[] arrayName = {value1, value2, ...};`

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of 5 integers
    numbers[0] = 10;
    string[] names = { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };
    ```

  * **Formatting Output:**

      * **String Interpolation (`$`):** A concise way to embed expressions directly within string literals.
      * **Composite Formatting (`string.Format()`):** Uses placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`) to insert values into a string.
      * **`Console.WriteLine()`:** Prints output to the console, with options for formatting.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    double price = 19.99;
    Console.WriteLine($"The price is: {price:C}"); // Currency format
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Item: {0}, Quantity: {1}", "Book", 2));
    ```

  * **The String Type and Common String Members:**

      * **`string`:** A reference type representing a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
      * **Common Members (Methods/Properties):**
          * `Length`: Gets the number of characters.
          * `ToUpper()`, `ToLower()`: Converts case.
          * `Contains()`: Checks if a substring exists.
          * `IndexOf()`: Finds the first occurrence of a character/substring.
          * `Substring()`: Extracts a portion of the string.
          * `Replace()`: Replaces occurrences of a substring.
          * `Trim()`: Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
          * `Split()`: Divides a string into an array of substrings.

### Week 2: Classes and Objects

This week delves into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C\#, focusing on classes, objects, and how to structure larger applications. You'll learn about code organization, dependency management, and fundamental testing practices.

#### **Learning Objectives:**

  * Master the concepts of classes, objects, properties, and methods.
  * Understand access modifiers and encapsulation.
  * Utilize NuGet for package management.
  * Design basic application architectures (MVC/Tiered).
  * Write unit tests for your code.

#### **Concepts Explained:**

  * **Enums:**

      * **Definition:** A special "class" that represents a group of named integral constants. They make code more readable and maintainable by using descriptive names instead of "magic numbers."
      * **Use Case:** Representing states, days of the week, or fixed categories.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public enum OrderStatus
    {
        Pending,
        Processing,
        Shipped,
        Delivered,
        Cancelled
    }
    ```

  * **Classes and Class Libraries:**

      * **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines properties (data) and methods (behavior).
      * **Object:** An instance of a class.
      * **Properties:** Getters/setters for class data.
      * **Methods:** Functions defined within a class.
      * **Constructors:** Special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.
      * **Access Modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`):** Control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
      * **Class Library:** A collection of compiled classes (a `.dll` file) that can be reused across different projects.

  * **The NuGet Package Manager:**

      * **Definition:** The package manager for .NET, similar to npm for Node.js or pip for Python. It allows developers to create, share, and consume useful code packages (libraries).
      * **Usage:** Used to easily add third-party libraries (e.g., for testing, data access, logging) to your project.
      * **Commands:** `dotnet add package [PackageName]` or via Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager UI.

  * **In-Memory Repositories:**

      * **Definition:** A simple implementation of the Repository pattern where data is stored directly in application memory (e.g., in a `List<T>`).
      * **Use Case:** Ideal for development, testing, or small applications where data persistence to a database isn't required or is mocked. It helps separate data access logic from business logic.

  * **MVC and Tiered Application Design:**

      * **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components:
          * **Model:** Manages application data, logic, and rules.
          * **View:** Displays the data from the Model to the user.
          * **Controller:** Handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects a View to display.
      * **Tiered Application Design (N-Tier):** Divides an application into logical and physical layers (tiers). Common tiers include:
          * **Presentation Tier (UI):** What the user sees and interacts with.
          * **Business Logic Tier:** Implements business rules and processes.
          * **Data Access Tier:** Handles communication with the database.
          * **Data Tier:** The database itself.
      * **Benefits:** Modularity, scalability, maintainability, and easier team collaboration.

  * **Unit Testing:**

      * **Definition:** A software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested in isolation to determine if they are fit for use.
      * **Frameworks:** Popular C\# unit testing frameworks include **xUnit**, NUnit, and MSTest.
      * **Principles:** Fast, isolated, repeatable, self-validating, timely.
      * **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern:** A common structure for unit tests.

  * **Advanced Class Design:**

      * **Inheritance:** Allows a class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (base class), promoting code reuse.
      * **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
      * **Abstract Classes & Methods:** Classes that cannot be instantiated directly and often contain abstract methods (which must be implemented by derived classes).
      * **Interfaces:** Contracts that define a set of methods, properties, or events that a class must implement.
      * **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the component's internals.
      * **Static Members:** Members that belong to the class itself, not to an instance of the class (e.g., `Math.PI`, `Console.WriteLine()`).

### Week 3: Intermediate & Advanced Concepts

This final week covers more advanced C\# features, including data structures, querying data, file I/O, error handling, and crucial concepts for building robust, scalable, and performant applications, especially in multi-threaded environments.

#### **Learning Objectives:**

  * Work with dates, times, and advanced collections.
  * Perform powerful data queries using LINQ.
  * Interact with the file system.
  * Implement robust error handling.
  * Understand and apply principles of concurrency and parallelism.
  * Utilize dependency injection for loosely coupled code.

#### **Concepts Explained:**

  * **The Date Time Type:**

      * **`DateTime` struct:** Represents a specific point in time.
      * **`TimeSpan` struct:** Represents a duration of time.
      * **Operations:** Adding/subtracting days, hours, comparing dates, formatting dates for display.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
    DateTime futureDate = now.AddDays(7);
    TimeSpan duration = futureDate - now;
    ```

  * **Big O Notation and Collections:**

      * **Big O Notation:** A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it's used to classify algorithms by how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
      * **Importance:** Helps in choosing the most efficient data structure and algorithm for a given task.
      * **Common Complexities:** O(1) constant, O(log n) logarithmic, O(n) linear, O(n log n) linearithmic, O(n^2) quadratic.
      * **Collections:** Data structures designed to store and manage groups of objects.

  * **Using List and Dictionary:**

      * **`List<T>`:** A generic, resizable array (dynamic array). It's part of `System.Collections.Generic`.
          * **Benefits:** Easy to add/remove elements, maintains order, fast access by index (O(1)).
          * **Drawbacks:** Slower insertions/deletions in the middle (O(n)).
      * **`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`:** A generic collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique.
          * **Benefits:** Extremely fast lookup, insertion, and deletion by key (average O(1)).
          * **Drawbacks:** No inherent order, keys must be unique.

  * **LINQ Query Writing:**

      * **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** A powerful feature in C\# that allows you to write queries directly in C\# code to retrieve data from various data sources (collections, databases, XML, etc.).
      * **Syntax:**
          * **Query Syntax (SQL-like):** More readable for complex queries.
          * **Method Syntax (Extension Methods):** More flexible and often preferred for simpler queries or chaining operations.
      * **Common Operations:** `Where` (filter), `Select` (transform), `OrderBy` (sort), `GroupBy` (group), `Join` (combine).

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Method Syntax
    var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).ToList();

    // Query Syntax
    var queryEvenNumbers = from n in numbers
                           where n % 2 == 0
                           select n;
    ```

  * **System.IO:**

      * **Purpose:** Provides types for reading and writing to data streams and files.
      * **Classes:**
          * `File`: Static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files.
          * `Directory`: Static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.
          * `StreamReader`, `StreamWriter`: For reading/writing text from/to files.
          * `FileStream`: For reading/writing binary data from/to files.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Writing to a file
    File.WriteAllText("log.txt", "Application started.");

    // Reading from a file
    string content = File.ReadAllText("config.txt");
    ```

  * **Exception Handling:**

      * **Purpose:** A mechanism to deal with runtime errors (exceptions) gracefully, preventing application crashes.
      * **Keywords:**
          * **`try`**: Contains the code that might throw an exception.
          * **`catch`**: Catches specific types of exceptions and handles them.
          * **`finally`**: Contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or was caught (e.g., for resource cleanup).
          * **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    try
    {
        int result = 10 / int.Parse("0"); // This will throw a DivideByZeroException
    }
    catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero!");
    }
    catch (FormatException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid number format!");
    }
    catch (Exception ex) // Generic catch for any other exception
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"An unexpected error occurred: {ex.Message}");
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Execution finished.");
    }
    ```

  * **Interfaces and the `IComparable` Interface:**

      * **Interfaces:** Define a contract. A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all members defined in that interface.
      * **`IComparable` Interface:** A built-in interface (`System` namespace) that defines a method (`CompareTo`) for comparing two objects of the same type. Implementing this allows objects of your custom class to be sorted (e.g., by `List.Sort()`).

  * **Dependency Injection (DI):**

      * **Concept:** A design pattern where objects (dependencies) are provided to a class by an external source (an "injector" or "IoC container") rather than being created by the class itself.
      * **Benefits:** Promotes loose coupling, improves testability, and makes code more modular and maintainable.
      * **Common Implementations:** Constructor Injection, Property Injection, Method Injection.

  * **Mocking:**

      * **Purpose:** Creating simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way, primarily for unit testing.
      * **Use Case:** Isolating the "unit under test" from its dependencies (e.g., a database, an external API) so that tests are fast, reliable, and repeatable.
      * **Libraries:** Popular mocking frameworks include **Moq**, NSubstitute, FakeItEasy.

  * **Multithreading:**

      * **Concept:** The ability of a CPU to execute multiple parts of a program (threads) concurrently. Each thread runs independently.
      * **Use Case:** Improving responsiveness of UI applications, performing long-running tasks in the background, leveraging multiple CPU cores.
      * **Challenges:** Race conditions, deadlocks, thread synchronization.

  * **TPL (Task Parallel Library):**

      * **Definition:** A set of public types and APIs in the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace that simplifies adding parallelism and concurrency to applications.
      * **Key Class:** `Task` represents an asynchronous operation.
      * **Benefits:** Abstracts away low-level thread management, making parallel programming easier and more robust.

  * **Parallelism Vs. Concurrency:**

      * **Concurrency:** Deals with **many things at once**. It's about structuring code so that multiple computations can be in progress over overlapping time periods, often by interleaving execution. A single-core CPU can achieve concurrency by rapidly switching between tasks.
      * **Parallelism:** Deals with **doing many things at once**. It's about executing multiple computations simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores or processors. Parallelism is a way to achieve concurrency.

  * **Asynchronous Programming:**

      * **Concept:** A programming paradigm that allows a program to start a long-running task and then continue executing other tasks without waiting for the long-running task to complete. When the long-running task finishes, it notifies the program.
      * **Keywords:** **`async`** and **`await`** in C\# simplify asynchronous programming, making asynchronous code look and feel like synchronous code.
      * **Use Case:** Non-blocking I/O operations (file access, network requests), improving UI responsiveness.

  * **Concurrent Collections:**

      * **Purpose:** Thread-safe collection classes designed for use in multithreaded scenarios. They handle internal synchronization, so you don't have to manually lock them.
      * **Namespace:** `System.Collections.Concurrent`.
      * **Examples:** `ConcurrentBag<T>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `ConcurrentQueue<T>`, `ConcurrentStack<T>`.
      * **Benefits:** Reduces the complexity of writing thread-safe code and avoids common concurrency bugs like race conditions when accessing shared collections.
